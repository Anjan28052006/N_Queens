# N-Queens Solver in Java

This project implements a solution to the classic **N-Queens** problem using Java. The program places N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## Problem Description

The goal is to arrange N queens on an N×N chessboard so that:  
- No two queens share the same row.  
- No two queens share the same column.  
- No two queens share the same diagonal.

## Features

- Uses backtracking algorithm to find all valid solutions.  
- Displays each valid board configuration.  
- Easily configurable for any board size N.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
2.Compile the Java program:
    ```bash
    javac N_queens.java
3.Run the program (replace N with desired board size):
     ```bash
    java N_queens N
