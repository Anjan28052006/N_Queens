# N-Queens Solver in Java



This project implements a solution to the classic **N-Queens** problem using Java. The program places N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## Problem Description

The goal is to arrange N queens on an N×N chessboard so that:  
- No two queens share the same row.  
- No two queens share the same column.  
- No two queens share the same diagonal.

## Features

- Uses backtracking algorithm to find all valid solutions.  
- Displays each valid board configuration.  
- Easily configurable for any board size N.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository, compile the program, and run it (replace N with desired board size):  
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>      # go into the cloned repo folder
   javac N_queens.java
   java N_queens N





EXAMPLE 
java N_Queens 4
